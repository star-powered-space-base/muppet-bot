# 3. Complete setup (builds and installs service)
make setup

# 4. Start the bot
make start

# 5. Watch logs
make logs-follow
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Format and lint code
make fmt
make lint

# Build and test
make check
make test

# Run locally for testing
make run
```

### Updating After Code Changes
```bash
# Quick update (rebuild and restart)
make update

# Or manually
make build-release
make restart
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check service status
make status

# View recent logs
make logs

# Follow logs in real-time
make logs-follow

# Export logs for analysis
make logs-export

# Check database
make db-status

# Backup database before making changes
make db-backup
```

### Uninstalling
```bash

## Tips

- Run `make` or `make help` at any time to see all available commands
- Most deployment commands require `sudo` for systemd operations
- The `setup` command automates the entire installation process
- Use `logs-follow` to monitor the bot in real-time
- Always run `env-check` to verify your configuration before deployment
- Use `db-backup` before making any database schema changes
